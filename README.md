# About

In this notebook, I use physics to mathematically model the visibility of fishing lines submerged in fresh water.  The models suggest nylon (monofilament) and fluorocarbon lines have similar underwater visibilities in fresh water, when comparing lines of the same diameter. The findings do not support marketing claims that fluorocarbon lines are invisible in water, or less visible than nylon lines.  See the [LineVisibilityModeling.ipynb](LineVisibilityModeling.ipynb) for details.


#### Example:  
Below, I show a picture of flourocarbon and nylon lines of similar diameters submerged in water. The fluorocarbon is clearly not invisible, and the two lines appear to have similar visibilities, which are key results indicated by the physics models.
