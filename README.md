In this notebook, I use physics to mathematically model the visibility of fishing lines submerged in fresh water.  The models suggest nylon and fluorocarbon materials have similar underwater visibilities in fresh water, when comparing lines of the same diameter. The findings do not support marketing claims that fluorocarbon lines are invisible in water.  See the notebook for details.
